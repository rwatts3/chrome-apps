wrapper's of the original app. Full credit of the wrapped application
goes to the original Author of the Application.

2. At the top of the page look for the button titled `Load unpacked extension...`
3. Navigate the folder of the extension you would like to use. 
4. Simply select that folder and load the files. 
5. If you have google chrome's desktop app launcher you should now be able to launch the application via it's icon.
